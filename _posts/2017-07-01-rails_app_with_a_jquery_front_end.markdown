### The Goal =>

The goal of this portfolio project is to continue building on our previous Rails portfolio project to include jQuery functionality. By utilizing jQuery it gives applications the ability to be dynamic. For example, when you are on Facebook (desktop) and you go to message someone it doesn't redirect you to a new page. Conveinently enough you are able to activate a little pop up box, or modal and message someone all while scrolling through your feed. There are many tools that help us to accomplish this dynamic behaivor. The tools I used in this project are very much low level and bare bones. Luckily some very talented programmers out there have written various libraries and frameworks for us to accomplish these dynamic features a bit more linearly but it is important to work at the low level to appreciate these abstractions.
