My first portfolio project for Flatiron School was to build my own Ruby gem! Let me tell you, I was intimidated. I put it off for a little while and went on to other sections of the course. Sometimes I do that when I am nervous. I wish I hadn't though because once I got into it, it was a lot of fun! It did take some set up, though. For instance, I was completely naive to the idea of a gem even though I had been using them in labs since starting to learn Ruby. Luckily the program offers a step by step guide to building a gem and that was a lifesaver! It really showed how to take all of your tools out of your toolbox and when to use them. 

The process started by using a really nice tool, Bundler! Essentially bundler set up the skeleton of your ruby gem by simply entering `bundle gem my_gem` in the command prompt. Upon doing that bundler sets up a perfect environment for your gem (e.g. needed files and directories). 

After that, it was about what do I want my gem to *do*? 

Well, I decided hey, I like trivia, so that means I must like facts! Why not a gem that generates random facts? So I did that. Except it wasn't just as easy as *that*. But, with what all I've learned in terms of OO principles and web scraping I definitely knew it was possible! 

So, I went through the example video again. After watching it I set up my requirements. The big one being my web scraping tool Nokogiri. Thank the web for Stack Overflow because web scraping is not always easy and when something in programming isn't easy, help can usually be found there! 

Anyway, a little ahead of myself. After the requirements, I started working on my CLI class. I initially hard-coded all of the menu options, but once I got into the scraping I generated everything that way. During the process, I tried very hard to keep my methods purposeful in the sense that they each had their own obvious contribution to the functionality of the program. That way if any issues arose, they would be easier to pinpoint. 

The bottom line is building CLI applications in Ruby is FUN! Once I go through the code review I know some things will be brought up to help me improve next time I build a gem! That's the wonderful thing about learning, it never ends, and certainly not when it comes to software development and technology in general!
