So, I was graduating early from high school in Gulf Shores, AL and I started thinking about what my plans for college were. I ended up attending university at The University of Alabama. It was driveable to home and visiting the campus took my breath away. It really is beautiful campus and well laid out university.

I really had no idea what I wanted to major in, I just knew what majors I wasn't interested in. Right around the time I got accepted (one month before the semester began) I met a guy Michael through a mutual friend. He was visiting home and now lived full time in Seattle, WA. I asked him about what he did, and he explained that he got a degree in Computer Science from The University of Alabama, and now worked for a tech company in Seattle as a software engineer. Aside from basic HTML and minor troubleshooting skills, I didn't know much about what it meant to be 'good' at computers. I knew about software, but not the semantics behind it.

Anyway, he gave me the example of Facebook Instant Messaging. He told me there are any number of things you can make that tiny box 'do' as a programmer. Anything you see on a webpage was built by a programmer and the result you see could have been implemented any number of ways. That really intrigued me. I decided to declare a major in CS and to start the track to see if it was a good fit.

I ended up loving my first programming class. We programmed in Python, which now I look back and realize how user-friendly that language is! ‚ù§ That was around 4 years ago and I've been learnin' more and more about software development ever since.
