<p>As a recent graduate in the field of Computer Science, I have the fundamentals down to begin my career. During my undergrad, web development always interested me, but my classes never gave me the tools to confidently dive in. After graduation, I started looking into web development boot camps and came across Flatiron School. I dove in and haven't looked back. I am finally getting the tools I need to be a successful web developer!</p>
